	<h2>My Journey</h2><hr class="rule">
	<p> Hi, I'm Nishant Saxena. I'm a self-taught UX/UI Designer, Graphic Designer and a Front-End Web Developer. I'm enthusiastic and prefer to grow my skills by keep on learning new things everyday. I am pursuing B-tech in Computer Science and engineering.<br><br>

       I started my journey as a designer in 2019. I soon learned that I have no more interest in programming so looked up on the internet the fastest growing career and most in-demand career options. So I found out UX/UI designing is something of my interest. Earlier I used to design posters on Adobe Photoshop, then I learned Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Xd. 
    </p><br><br>

    <h2>How I started ?</h2><hr class="rule">
    <p>I explored Behance, Dribbble, Instagram and Pinterest for weeks to learn from other designers.
       I watched YouTube videos of how to build a portfolio as a designer. I expanded my connections on LinkedIn,
       interacted with other designers and watched there portfolio.<br><br>
       I started designing logos, brochures & visiting cards too just to learn the idea of designing and color theory.
       Then I designed Icons on Illustrator by practicing icon of iOS and Android.<br><br>
       Finally I landed my feet to UX/UI designing. I took an online course on Udemy for Adobe Xd and basic UX/UI
       designing. I started designing app screens for the brand logos I created in Illustrator.  
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>How Created My Portfolio ?</h2><hr class="rule">
    <p>As I explored YouTube and interacted with other designers, they advised me that in order to reach out to 
       recruiters I must have great portfolio on Behance or LinkedIn or Dribbble. Some of them even advised me
       to have a personal website to display my work. Having a website creates a great impact on recruiters.<br><br>
       This is where my engineering knowledge came into being. I first designed my website on Adobe Xd. I kept on 
       changing the designs for days. I searched and went through the websites of different designers. Once the design 
       was final I started coding my website. And hence how I created my portfolio.  
    </p>	
    <h2>An Extra Mile</h2><hr class="rule">
    <p>I realized I don't own any certification for UX/UI designing. So I logged in into Coursera and completed few
       courses for the same.<br><br>
       Since my portfolio is created, now I'm brushing my skills by designing daily and working as an Intern and
       freelancing as a designer.<br><br>
       I look forward to see what other opportunities are out there for me as I strive to be a great designer.
